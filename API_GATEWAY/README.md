# Authentication and Authorization

## Authentication
To identify a user, you need to authenticate the user. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user.  WHO ARE YOU ?

## Authorization
Assigning permissions to users and groups is called authorization.  WHAT CAN YOU DO ?


# JWT
JASON WEB TOKEN (JWT) is a standard for creating tokens that assert some number of claims.  JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.
